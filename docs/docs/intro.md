Welcome to the Structura docs. Use the sidebar to browse the major areas of the platform:

- [Ingestion Overview](./ingestion-pipeline/overview) for how source content enters Structura.
- [AST Schema](./ast-system/normalized-ast-schema) for the normalized syntax tree shape.
- [AST Examples](./ast-system/examples) for concrete before/after samples.
- [Dependency Graph Model](./graph-system/dependency-graph-model) for how relationships are modeled.
- [Graph Extraction](./graph-system/call-graph-extraction) for call/member/import/assignment edges.
- [Snapshot Materializer](./learning/snapshot-materializer) for building immutable ML snapshots.
- [Postgres Schema](./databases/postgres-schema) for storage tables.

These pages are living references. When evolving ingestion, parsers, graph pipelines, or learning tooling, add notes here so every team shares the same mental model.
