Welcome to the Structura docs. Use the sidebar to browse the major areas of the platform:

- [Ingestion Overview](./ingestion-overview) for how source content enters Structura.
- [Dependency Graph](./dependency-graph) for how relationships are modeled.
- [AST Schema](./ast-schema) for the normalized syntax tree shape.
- [Normalization Examples](./normalization/variables) for concrete before/after samples.

These pages are living references. When evolving ingestion, parsers, or graph pipelines, add notes here so every team shares the same mental model.
